Has the feel of a classic Bond movie. LOVED it. I say A\n,  007\n,  Powerhouse of a Movie\n,  The sky is falling\n,  disappointing and ridiculously plotted\n,  007 reporting for duty\n,  Home Alone\n,  How safe do you feel?\n,  Skyfall- 007 Reloaded!\n,  Familiar, yet original\n,  Bond on a budget starring the old folks home\n,  Competently directed but full of plot holes and strange narrative decisions\n,  The name is Bond. James Bond. & this movie is awesome, because of him! Skyfall is worth watching.\n,  These Films Could Use Some Tightening Up!\n,  Roger Ebert gave Bond 4 stars and I do as well\n,  Not a Bond film, this is the Anti-Bond film\n,  A Bond for a new era\n,  50 Years and Still Strong\n,  Not as good as the reviews say but still good\n,  Wow!\n,  Skyfail!! Fire Daniel Craig!!\n,  James Bombed: formulaic film-making at its worst.\n,  Mission Success\n",

Come back with your shield, or on it.\"\n,  Somewhat entertaining folkloric celebration of the ongoing war against tyranny featuring animated Greek statues\n,  Racist, nationalistic crap\n,  Brutal and Spectacular!\n,  my notes\n,  One-Eyed Reporter\n",
